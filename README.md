# Adventofcode Solutions

I saw a lot of people posting their solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges, so I thought I'd give it a go myself. 

I'm using this as an opportunity to practice problem-solving skill.

I really like the part-two challenges, this is similar to the problems we have in real-world. 

So basically, even it's a small problem, if you have a good architecture, it makes it easier to adapt to new requirements.

I'm not expecting to be very fast at solving the challenges. Besides the correctness of the solution, I also value following aspects:

- Good architecture
- Easy to understand
- Efficiency

I started from aoc2015, and I'm planning to do all the challenges from 2015 to 2023.
